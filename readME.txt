Files:
File1.txt //contains some text to be used for cartesian product
Fill2.txt //contains some text to be used for cartesian product
File3.txt //empty after you run the code it will have cartesian pairs of the contents of the above two files.
cartesian.php //this is the php file which uses File1 anf Fill2 to produce cartesian product and write them to the File3.
NOTE : THIS IS ORIGINAL CODE WRITEN BY ME PLEASE DON'T SHARE IT WITH ANYONE.
